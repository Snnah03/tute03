### General Information 
My project that I developed for A3 was a data visualisation of who is the most popular 5 star character in Genshin Impact. Genshin Impact is a gacha game that i have personaly interest in and have enjoyment from which inspired me to base my assignment around it.

### Technologies
The resources I used were excel sheets to input my data into, which was then imported into a tableau sheet where I created the data visualisation.
